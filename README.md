# CLI::Console
[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/cli-console.png)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/cli-console)

Basic library for making interactive command-line applications much easier.


## Features

* Easy way to add commands and help info to them so it can be shown to user.
* Auto-completion for commands.
* Command aliasing.


## Installation

Simply

`gem install cli-console`

### Dependecies

This library doesn't have any dependencies.
Well actually there are no direct dependencies.
In reality you do need [HighLine](http://rubygems.org/gems/highline).
Then why did I say there's no dependencies?
Because `CLI::Console` will accept any class implementing those few functions currently provided by HighLine.

Also, this library requires Ruby version 1.9.x or newer (works fine with 2.0)

## Usage Example

Take a look at [examples/shell.rb](examples/shell.rb)

## Documentation

YARD with markdown is used for documentation

## Specs

RSpec and simplecov are required, to run tests just `rake spec`
code coverage will also be generated
